# Welcome to the Camunda Community Hub Repository Template!

## A project to empower our open source community extension maintainers, and encourage new contributors to get started contributing to the Camunda open source ecosystem.

If you are building a new Camunda Community extension, please follow the instructions detailed in our [Community Repository](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/community). Once those steps have been completed, please feel free to make use of this repository to build your new extension from!
